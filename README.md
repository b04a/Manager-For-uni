A couple of pictures from the project.

Project - Manager for University
Programming language - Swift
Framework, libraries - SwiftUI, CoreData, Api
What's new:
As the error occurred, it was possible to learn something new.

There are 3 pages in this application:
1. Displayed all data (full calendar data, weather in Kazan, number of notes taken)
2. Couples schedule (+ since I completed the project, I have not added the function to add a custom schedule)
3. Creating notes 

I decided to complete the project, because I want to start learning new material. 

P.s. This project has no architecture and also is not optimized for code.
